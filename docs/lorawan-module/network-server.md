=== "Chirpstack"

    Chirpstack is an open sourced LoRaWAN network server, that can be easily set up. The below is based on the default Chirpstack settings, check with whoever set up your Chirpstack to confirm how it is configured.


    ## MQTT 
     Chirpstack has a built in broker for sharing data, SiteSync will connect to this integration.

    The MQTT integration will have the following fields to copy into SiteSync to create the MQTT connection.

    | SiteSync Field                | Description                                                                                   |
    |-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | Broker URL or IP Address    | the URL that you access your instance of Chirpstack at, without http://                                            |
    | Port                        | 1883                                    |
    | MQTT Topic                  | application/{chirpstack-application-id}/device/+/event/up                                         |
    
    *On the MQTT Topic, replace {chirpstack-application-id} with the chirpstack application ID that your synced devices are in*

    Default is no MQTT username or password or authentication required, but SiteSync recommends setting authentication to secure the data on your broker.
